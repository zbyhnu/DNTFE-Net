1. Download the executable file (detect.exe) locally.
2. Opening the executable brings up the console.
3. Two messages need to be entered within the console. The first piece of information is the absolute path of the sonar image to be tested. The second piece of information is the output path of the test result.
4. On windows operating systems, all paths must be in "\" to avoid reporting errors, e.g. "C:\Users\Desktop\00". The input sonar image must be a single image, this executable does not support multiple simultaneous processing.
5. You can execute the file without installing the environment, and don't bother with issues related to environment configuration.
6. The naming format of the sonar data must conform:text_CSSTD_XX_(left/right).png; e.g.test_CSSTD_4_left.png
